# Basic cipher methods on several languages

I've decided to run this repository in order to help "ma comrades" with implementing and **understanding** basic cryptography algorithms listed in the subfolders of the languages (e.g List of the methods implemented on Java are written in the ./java/README.md).

This folder contains algorithms listed below:
- *Diffie-Hellman* cipher algorithm
- *ElGamal* cipher algorithm

## Getting started

Clone this repository
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/soundsnick/cryptography
```
***Go into your language folder and read the next instructions in README.md of subfolders.***

## Version
