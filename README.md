# Basic cipher methods on Ruby

I've decided to run this repository in order to help "ma comrades" with implementing and **understanding** basic cryptography algorithms listed below:
- Caesar cipher method
- Substitution cipher method

## Getting started

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/soundsnick/cryptography
```
Go into your language folder and run algorithm you want using your interpreter/compiler.
Example using Ruby:
